# Python library for reading and evaluating digital calibration certificates (DCC) 

PyDCC is a library for reading and evaluating digital calibration certificates (DCCs) according to the official DCC version 3.0.0 [3]. 
This collaborative work was introduced by a talk given at the 2nd DCC conference [4]. 
Note that to process DCC automatically, data within the DCC must follow particular format requirements defined by Good Practice [5].

Out of scope: PyDCC is not intended to modify or generate DCCs.

## General Software Information

This software module is a joint initiative driven by the project [GEMIMEG-II.](https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Navigation/DE/ProgrammeProjekte/AktuelleStrategischeEinzelprojekte/gemimeg2/gemimeg2.html)

Maintainer: [Andreas Tobola](mailto:pydcc.t@siemens.com), Siemens AG

## License

The software was generally licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). Therefore, see the LICENSE file in the top-level directory.

[Data examples](data) included in this repository may contain other licenses. Please refer to the license declarations within the data examples.

## Background to DCC

The digital calibration certificate (DCC) is the machine-readable counterpart of the previous calibration certificate. The DCC was released by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) [1]. The DCC has a hierarchical structure comprising regulated areas whose information must meet specific requirements. The DCC exists in Extensible Markup Language (XML). 

## Aim of this software library

Python is a programming language widely used in science and cloud computing applications. This software library extends Python by capabilities of handling DCC, in particular, loading DCCs from XML-Files, and operating on regulated areas of the DCC. Regulated areas in DCC are (1) administrative data and (2) measurement results. 

Consider reading the [user guide](doc/pydcc.md) for more details, including API documentation.

Further, the [contibution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) explains how one can contribute to this software module.
